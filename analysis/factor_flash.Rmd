## Introduction

In this part, we used ['flashr'](https://github.com/stephenslab/flashr), methods for matrix factorization based on [Empirical Bayes Matrix Factorization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06931), to extract factors from IDIN gene expression matrix (same with the matrix in [IDIN-PLIER](https://xsun1229.github.io/pathway_analysis/IDIN.html)).We also performed factor analysis find if any factor associates with the two SNPs ( [rs9557207](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/rs9557207) and [rs11616269](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/rs11616269))

## Material and Methods

1. We used workflow showed in ['flashr'](https://github.com/stephenslab/flashr) to extract factors. 

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=T}
f = flash(Y)    ### Y is the IDIN gene expression matrix.
ldf = flash_get_ldf(f)
```

2. Then, we used the backfitting algorithm to improve the fit (but it takes longer).

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=T}
f.b = flash(Y, f_init = f, backfit=TRUE, greedy=FALSE)
ldf.b = flash_get_ldf(f.b)
```

3. Perform association test between the facotrs and two SNPs. 

## Results

We obtained 62 factors using FLASH.

### Association test

We performed linear regression for factors ~ snp.

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=T}
  ### k indicates the kth factors
  y <- as.numeric(factors[,k])   ## kth factors
  x <- as.numeric(geno_2snp[,1])   ## genotype of rs11616269
  
  pval_snp1[k] <- summary(lm(y ~ x))$coefficients[2,4]  ## pval of F-statistics in y ~ x regression
  rsq_snp1[k] <- summary(lm(y ~ x))$r.squared    ## r-squared of the regression
```

We made a histogram to show the pvalue distribution.

The table below shows the detailed results of the linear regression. 

Notations: **pval** is the pvalue of F-statistics in regression. **rsq** is the r-squared of the regression.

You can sort the table by clicking the arrow by the header of each column.
