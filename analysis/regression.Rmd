## Introduction

In this part, we will use lasso regression to train a prediction model. The dependent variables here are LVs (extracted from (pwy-plier-nochrx)[https://xsun1229.github.io/pathway_analysis/pwy_plier-nochrx.html]) and the independent variables are genotype of certain variants. (LVs ~ variant genotype)


## Data

We used whole blood gene expression data from GTEx including 670 samples. In genptype data, there are 10,726,225 variants in total. 

## Variant selection
