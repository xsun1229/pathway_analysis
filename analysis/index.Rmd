## Pathway analysis
KEGG is a collection of databases dealing with genomes, biological pathways, diseases, drugs, and chemical substances. For each pathway of human, we inferred the PCs and PEER factors of it. Then computed the heritabilities of factors and made a summary of the heritabilities.

## pwy-plier
PLIER(pathway-level information extractor) is a broadly applicable method to accurately infer relevant biological insights, such as variation in cell-type proportion or pathway activity, from global gene expression studies. It approximates the expression pattern of every gene as a linear combination of eigengene-like latent variables (LVs). We calculated heritability of these LVs and performed further analysis.

## pwy-plier-nochrx

In last part, we extracted LVs from gene expression matrix which includes chrX, but it maybe more accurate to exclude chrX. So, we performed analysis for the data excluding chrX.

## Factor-TWAS

We have extract factors(LVs) related to pathways from gene expression data and calculated their heritability in former analysis. We plan to use TWAS to find the association between diseases and pathways/factors. TWAS analyse can be divided into training and prediction part. 

### Training part

In this part, we will use lasso and elastic_net regression to train a prediction model. The dependent variables here are LVs and the independent variables are genotype of certain variants.

We also trained a model for the fifth pc of T1B pathway.
