## Pathway analysis
KEGG is a collection of databases dealing with genomes, biological pathways, diseases, drugs, and chemical substances. For each pathway of human, we inferred the PCs and PEER factors of it. Then computed the heritabilities of factors and made a summary of the heritabilities.

## pwy-plier
PLIER(pathway-level information extractor) is a broadly applicable method to accurately infer relevant biological insights, such as variation in cell-type proportion or pathway activity, from global gene expression studies. It approximates the expression pattern of every gene as a linear combination of eigengene-like latent variables (LVs). We calculated heritability of these LVs and performed further analysis.
