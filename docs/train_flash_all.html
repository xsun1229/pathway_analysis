Using absolute paths to the files within your workflowr project makes it difficult for you and others to run your code on a different machine. Change the absolute path(s) below to the suggested relative path(s) to make your code more reproducible.

Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility.

<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version <a href="https://github.com/xsun1229/pathway_analysis/tree/30762e41846ad0d2c3bd035abe9d33dc63aff257" target="_blank">30762e4</a>. See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:

<pre><code>
Ignored files:
    Ignored:    .RData
    Ignored:    .Rhistory

Unstaged changes:

    Deleted:    output/snp001_le.jpeg

</code></pre>
<p>
Note that any generated files, e.g. HTML, png, CSS, etc., are not included in this status report because it is ok for generated content to have uncommitted changes.

<li><p>We splited the data set into training(80%, 536 samples) and test(20%, 134 samples) set.</p></li>
<li><p>In the training data, performed association test between the 100 factors and all SNPs using Plink. We corrected the results for genotype PCs (We used Plink to compute 10 PCs and used them as corvariates in association test).</p></li>
<li><p>From the results of last step, we selected all SNPs with p &lt; 1e-02. For each factor, we can get a set of around 100,000 variants.</p></li>
<li><p>Trained the prediction models using SNPs from last step in the training data and evaluated the performance in the testing data. (Using glmnet package)</p></li>

<h3>Summary table for prediction model</h3>
<p>The table below shows the heritability of factorss and performance of the training models. The table has been sorted by Heritability from small to large.</p>
<p>Some notations to explain: <strong>rsq_min</strong> is the r-squared when lambda=lambda.min, <strong>ncoef_nzero_min</strong> is the number of non-zero coefficients when lambda=lambda.min, <strong>rsq_test</strong> is the r-squared in testing set (obtained from lm(factor.obs ~ factor.pred)) ,<strong>pval_test</strong> is the pvalue of F-statistics in testing set. When the suffix is ’_1se’, the notations mean lambda=lambda.1se. Suffix ’_l’ means lasso regression and ’_e’ means elastic_net</p>
<pre class="r"><code>  ###Lasso regression. &#39;k&#39; represents the kth factor.
    fit_lasso &lt;- cv.glmnet(x, y, alpha =1, foldid = foldid)   ##&#39;foldid = foldid&#39; can fix the data partition in cross validation, making the codes reproducible
    fit_r_train_l[k]  &lt;- fit_lasso$glmnet.fit$dev.ratio[which(fit_lasso$glmnet.fit$lambda == fit_lasso$lambda.min)]  ###r2 when lambda = lambda.min
    predict_l &lt;- predict(fit_lasso, nx, s = fit_lasso$lambda.min )
    
    fit_linear &lt;- lm(y_test ~ predict_l)
    pval_test_l[i] &lt;- summary(fit_linear)$coefficients[,4]
    rsq_test_l[i] &lt;- summary(fit_linear)$r.squared</code></pre>
<p>In this table, there are several NA value. These NA values come from linear regression(lm(y_test ~ predict_l)). It means the variant in regression is linearly with the intercept. After checking the predict_l, we found the predict_l for all samples are the same.</p>

<h3>Factors with relatively low pval_test_l</h3>
<p>By sorting the pval_test_l in the table above, we can get several factors that have very low pvalues on testing set (factor 95,20,69,67). We made scatter plots of predicted factors vs. observed factors for them. Besides, we did GWAS analysis.</p>
<p>The red line in manhattan plot means p-value is 5e-8.</p>
