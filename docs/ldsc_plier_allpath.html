Using absolute paths to the files within your workflowr project makes it difficult for you and others to run your code on a different machine. Change the absolute path(s) below to the suggested relative path(s) to make your code more reproducible.

Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility.
</p>
<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version <a href="https://github.com/xsun1229/pathway_analysis/tree/40ea3a00dfb59e53660297df2afcb55edf8b9a7a" target="_blank">40ea3a0</a>. See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:
</p>
<pre><code>
Ignored files:
    Ignored:    .RData
    Ignored:    .Rhistory
    Ignored:    .Rproj.user/

Unstaged changes:
    Deleted:    output/ebi2_mse_le.jpeg
    Deleted:    output/snp001_le.jpeg

</code></pre>
<p>
Note that any generated files, e.g. HTML, png, CSS, etc., are not included in this status report because it is ok for generated content to have uncommitted changes.

These are the previous versions of the repository in which changes were made to the R Markdown (<code>analysis/ldsc_plier_allpath.Rmd</code>) and HTML (<code>docs/ldsc_plier_allpath.html</code>) files.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>We adopted LD score regression to estimate SNP-based heritability and partation the heritability into seperate categories. The software we used here is <a href="https://github.com/bulik/ldsc">ldsc</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="material-and-methods" class="section level2">
<h2>Material and Methods</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The software ‘ldsc’ uses GWAS summary statistics as inputs. The GWAS summary statistics we adopted here came from the association tests for plier factors (nochrx, allpathway, MHC included)using training data (536 samples)in <a href="https://xsun1229.github.io/pathway_analysis/train_model_allpath.html">train_model_allpath</a>. We converted the GWAS results into following format(taking lv73, the one has the highest heritability as an example).</li>
</ol>
<pre class="r"><code>head(sum_nox_allpath_lv73.txt)

<p>The ‘SNP’ IDs here are from dbSNP 151, We downloaded the correspondence between dbSNP 151 and GTEx variant ID from the <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/gtex_analysis_v8/reference/GTEx_Analysis_2017-06-05_v8_WholeGenomeSeq_838Indiv_Analysis_Freeze.lookup_table.txt.gz">GTEx portal</a></p>
<p>The ‘N’ here stands for the the number of non-missing samples for each variants.</p>
<p>‘Z’ is the z-score for each variants. We computed it from p-value and effect size. Z=sign(Effect Size)×|phi^(-1)(p/2)|. phi^(-1) is the inverse cumulative distribution function of the normal distribution.</p>
<p>A1 is the alternative allele and A2 is the reference allele.</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The LD scores (baseline.* in 1000G_Phase1_baseline_ldscores.tgz), regression weights (weights.* in weights_hm3_no_hla.tgz), and allele frequencies (1000G.mac5eur.* in 1000G_Phase1_frq.tgz) were downloaded from <a href="https://data.broadinstitute.org/alkesgroup/LDSCORE/">here</a> (provided by the software, they used 53 annotations).</p></li>
<li><p>After running</p>
<p>python ldsc.py –h2 ./../data_pre/summary_gwas/sum_nox_allpath_lv73.txt –ref-ld-chr ./baseline/baseline. –w-ld-chr ./weights_hm3_no_hla/weights. –overlap-annot –frqfile-chr ./1000G_frq/1000G.mac5eur. –out ./../results/lv73_test</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We obtained the enrichment result of factors. We made a plot to show the heritability enrichment in each category.</p>

<div id="results" class="section level2">
<h2>Results</h2>
<div id="enrichment-plots" class="section level3">
<h3>Enrichment plots</h3>
<p>We performed LD score regression for lv40(the one has lowest pvalue on testing set <em>pval_test_l</em>) and lv73(the one has the highest heritability) from <a href="https://xsun1229.github.io/pathway_analysis/train_model_allpath.html">plier-nochrx-allpathway</a>.</p>
<p>We made several plots to show the enrichment and 95% confidence intervals for each lv.</p>
