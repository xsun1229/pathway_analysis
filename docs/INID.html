Using absolute paths to the files within your workflowr project makes it difficult for you and others to run your code on a different machine. Change the absolute path(s) below to the suggested relative path(s) to make your code more reproducible.

Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility.
</p>
<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version <a href="https://github.com/xsun1229/pathway_analysis/tree/27506c05a87163a503706420e2973fb642f89e1a" target="_blank">27506c0</a>. See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:
</p>
<pre><code>
Ignored files:
    Ignored:    .RData
    Ignored:    .Rhistory
    Ignored:    .Rproj.user/

Unstaged changes:
    Deleted:    analysis/regression.Rmd
    Deleted:    output/LV101_ldpr.jpeg
    Deleted:    output/LV5.jpeg
    Deleted:    output/nzero_variants.rdata
    Deleted:    output/snp001_le.jpeg

</code></pre>
<p>
Note that any generated files, e.g. HTML, png, CSS, etc., are not included in this status report because it is ok for generated content to have uncommitted changes.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3241411/">Bayesian detection of expression quantitative trait [Genetics, 2011]</a>, authors used HESS to analyze the larger IDIN(IRF7-driven inflammatory network) and found two SNPs, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/rs9557207">rs9557207</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/rs11616269">rs11616269</a>,which are detected as hotspots for the IDIN expression.</p>
<p>Here, we perform factor analysis using IDIN genes in whole blood data (GTEx) to find if any factor associates with the two SNPs.</p>

<li><p>There are 524 genes(ensembl.id) in IDIN. 483 of them have expression data in whole blood data (GTEx). After converting ensembl.id into hgnc_symbol, 480 genes left. We used the gene expression matrix to of these genes to extract PLIER factors (LVs).</p></li>
<li><p>We used CanonicalPathways in PLIER R package, which contains 545 curated pathways from Reactome and KEGG. Among 480 genes, CanonicalPathways contains 255 genes.</p></li>

<p>The table below shows the detailed results of the linear regression.</p>
<p>Notations: <strong>LV_AUC</strong> is an indicator to show the confidence that LV will associate with some pathways. AUV &gt; 0.7 means high confidence. <strong>pval</strong> is the pvalue of F-statistics in regression. <strong>rsq</strong> is the r-squared of the regression.</p>
