Using absolute paths to the files within your workflowr project makes it difficult for you and others to run your code on a different machine. Change the absolute path(s) below to the suggested relative path(s) to make your code more reproducible.

Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility.
</p>
<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version <a href="https://github.com/xsun1229/pathway_analysis/tree/439e8949122f42f79c631da278acae574241237c" target="_blank">439e894</a>. See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:
</p>
<pre><code>
Ignored files:
    Ignored:    .RData
    Ignored:    .Rhistory
    Ignored:    .Rproj.user/

Unstaged changes:
    Deleted:    analysis/regression.Rmd
    Deleted:    output/LV101_ldpr.jpeg
    Deleted:    output/LV5.jpeg
    Deleted:    output/nzero_variants.rdata
    Deleted:    output/snp001_le.jpeg

</code></pre>
<p>
Note that any generated files, e.g. HTML, png, CSS, etc., are not included in this status report because it is ok for generated content to have uncommitted changes.

These are the previous versions of the repository in which changes were made to the R Markdown (<code>analysis/train_model.Rmd</code>) and HTML (<code>docs/train_model.html</code>) files. If you’ve configured a remote Git repository (see <code>?wflow_git_remote</code>), click on the hyperlinks in the table below to view the files as they were in that past version.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In this part, we will use lasso/elastic_net regression to train prediction models. The dependent variables here are LVs extracted from <a href="https://xsun1229.github.io/pathway_analysis/pwy-plier-nochrx.html">pwy-plier-nochrx</a> and the independent variables are genotype of certain variants. (LVs ~ variant genotype)</p>
</div>
<div id="material-and-methods" class="section level2">
<h2>Material and Methods</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>We used whole blood genotype data from GTEx including 670 samples. In genptype data, there are 10,403,249 variants in total (variants in chrX have been excluded). There are some missing values in our dataset. We used mean imputation (substitue the missing values with mean value of the corresponding variants) to impute the missing value.</li>
</ol>

</figure>
<p>The missing data pattern of our dataset. x-axis represents the proportion of missing value for each variant. y-axis represents the number of the variants.</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>We splited the data set into training(80%, 536 samples) and test(20%, 134 samples) set.</p></li>
<li><p>In the training data, performed association test between the 128 LVs and all SNPs using Plink. We corrected the results for genotype PCs (We used Plink to compute 10 PCs and used them as corvariates in association test).</p></li>
<li><p>From 3, we selected all SNPs with p &lt; 1e-02. For each LV, we can get a set of around 100,000 variants.</p></li>
<li><p>Trained Lasso/Elastic net using SNPs from step4 in the training data and evaluated the performance in the testing data.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Heritability vs R-squared</h3>
<p>This figure shows the prediction performance (R2 of Lasso/Elastic_net regression on training set in red) in comparison to LV heritability estimates (black; standard errors in gray). Performance was assessed using tenfold cross-validation in the GTEx whole-blood cohort (on training set, n = 536) with the elastic net and lasso models.</p>

<div id="debugging" class="section level2">
<h2>Debugging</h2>
<p>There seems to be some overfitting problems. So I did some debuggings.</p>
<div id="table" class="section level3">
<h3>Table</h3>
<p>The table below shows the heritability of LVs and performance of the training models. The table has been sorted by Heritability from small to large.</p>
<p>Some notations to explain: <strong>rsq_min</strong> is the r-squared when lambda=lambda.min, <strong>ncoef_nzero_min</strong> is the number of non-zero coefficients when lambda=lambda.min, <strong>rsq_test</strong> is the r-squared in testing set (obtained from lm(lv.obs ~ lv.pred)) ,<strong>pval_test</strong> is the pvalue of F-statisticsin testing test. When the suffix is ’_1se’, the notations mean lambda=lambda.1se. Suffix ’_l’ means lasso regression and ’_e’ means elastic_net</p>
<pre class="r"><code>  ###Lasso regression. &#39;k&#39; represents the kth LV.
    fit_lasso &lt;- cv.glmnet(x, y, alpha =1, foldid = foldid)   ##&#39;foldid = foldid&#39; can fix the data partition in cross validation, making the codes reproducible
    fit_r_train_l[k]  &lt;- fit_lasso$glmnet.fit$dev.ratio[which(fit_lasso$glmnet.fit$lambda == fit_lasso$lambda.min)]  ###r2 when lambda = lambda.min
    predict_l &lt;- predict(fit_lasso, nx, s = fit_lasso$lambda.min )
    
    fit_linear &lt;- lm(y_test ~ predict_l)
    pval_test_l[i] &lt;- summary(fit_linear)$coefficients[,4]
    rsq_test_l[i] &lt;- summary(fit_linear)$r.squared</code></pre>
<p>Some LVs like LV6,LV8 have pretty low heritability but have very high r-squared. In such LVs, the training model always selected many variants(ncoef_nzero). Other LVs like LV101,LV113 have relatively high heritability but very low r-squared.In such LVs, the training model always selected few variants(ncoef_nzero).</p>
<p>It seems that the r-squared issue is a variante selection issue?</p>
<p>In this table, there are several NA value. These NA values come from linear regression(lm(y_test ~ predict_l)). It means the variant in regression is linearly with the intercept. After checking the predict_l, we found the predict_l for all samples are the same.</p>

<h3>lv6 and lv101</h3>
<p>Taking lv6(low heritability but high r2) and lv101(high heritability but low r2) as examples, we made sveral plots to show the models. Since the lasso and elastic_net models were not quite different, we just post the plots from lasso regression here.</p>
<p>We first plot the change of mean squared errors and coefficients when training the model using lasso. We also plot the predicted lv values vs observed lv values.</p>

<p>For LV101, we performned more analysis to detect the reason why it has relatively high heritability(0.19) but low r-squared(0.071) in lasso.</p>
<div id="variants-with-non-zero-coefficients" class="section level5">
<h5>Variants with non-zero coefficients</h5>
<p>We got 15 variants with non-zero lasso coefficients. For these variants, we performed single snp linear regression (LV101 ~ genotype of a snp) and made conparision in both training set and testing set.</p>
<p>Notations: <strong>coefficients_lasso</strong> is the coefficients from the lasso model. <strong>pval_lm_traindata</strong> is the p-value of F-statistics from the linear regression using the training set data. <strong>rsq_lm_traindata</strong> is the r-squared of the linear regression using training set data. Suffix &quot;_testdata&quot; means the results using testing set.</p>

the presentation more consistent at the cost of the webpage sometimes
taking slightly longer to load. Note that this only works because the
