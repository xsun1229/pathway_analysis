Using absolute paths to the files within your workflowr project makes it difficult for you and others to run your code on a different machine. Change the absolute path(s) below to the suggested relative path(s) to make your code more reproducible.

Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility.
</p>
<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version <a href="https://github.com/xsun1229/pathway_analysis/tree/2648119cdddec383596ade8a9d6e09a4545b2d5b" target="_blank">2648119</a>. See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:
</p>
<pre><code>
Ignored files:
    Ignored:    .RData
    Ignored:    .Rhistory
    Ignored:    .Rproj.user/

Unstaged changes:
    Deleted:    output/ebi2_mse_le.jpeg
    Deleted:    output/snp001_le.jpeg

</code></pre>
<p>
Note that any generated files, e.g. HTML, png, CSS, etc., are not included in this status report because it is ok for generated content to have uncommitted changes.

These are the previous versions of the repository in which changes were made to the R Markdown (<code>analysis/train_model_allpath.Rmd</code>) and HTML (<code>docs/train_model_allpath.html</code>) files.

<h3>Heritability vs R-squared</h3>
<p>This figure shows the prediction performance (R2 of Lasso/Elastic_net regression on training set in red) in comparison to LV heritability estimates (black; standard errors in gray). Performance was assessed using tenfold cross-validation in the GTEx whole-blood cohort (on training set, n = 536) with the elastic net and lasso models.</p>

<h3>Table</h3>
<p>The table below shows the heritability of LVs and performance of the training models. The table has been sorted by Heritability from small to large.</p>
<p>Some notations to explain: <strong>rsq_min</strong> is the r-squared when lambda=lambda.min, <strong>ncoef_nzero_min</strong> is the number of non-zero coefficients when lambda=lambda.min, <strong>rsq_test</strong> is the r-squared in testing set (obtained from lm(lv.obs ~ lv.pred)) ,<strong>pval_test</strong> is the pvalue of F-statistics in testing set. When the suffix is ’_1se’, the notations mean lambda=lambda.1se. Suffix ’_l’ means lasso regression and ’_e’ means elastic_net</p>
<pre class="r"><code>  ###Lasso regression. &#39;k&#39; represents the kth LV.
    fit_lasso &lt;- cv.glmnet(x, y, alpha =1, foldid = foldid)   ##&#39;foldid = foldid&#39; can fix the data partition in cross validation, making the codes reproducible
    fit_r_train_l[k]  &lt;- fit_lasso$glmnet.fit$dev.ratio[which(fit_lasso$glmnet.fit$lambda == fit_lasso$lambda.min)]  ###r2 when lambda = lambda.min
    predict_l &lt;- predict(fit_lasso, nx, s = fit_lasso$lambda.min )
    
    fit_linear &lt;- lm(y_test ~ predict_l)
    pval_test_l[i] &lt;- summary(fit_linear)$coefficients[,4]
    rsq_test_l[i] &lt;- summary(fit_linear)$r.squared</code></pre>
<p>Some LVs like LV6, have pretty low heritability but have very high r-squared. In such LVs, the training model always selected many variants(ncoef_nzero). Other LVs like LV76, LV89 have relatively high heritability but very low r-squared.In such LVs, the training model always selected few variants(ncoef_nzero).</p>
<p>In this table, there are several NA value. These NA values come from linear regression(lm(y_test ~ predict_l)). It means the variant in regression is linearly with the intercept. After checking the predict_l, we found the predict_l for all samples are the same.</p>

<h3>lv6 and lv89</h3>
<p>Taking lv6(low heritability but high r2) and lv89(high heritability but low r2) as examples, we made sveral plots to show the models. Since the lasso and elastic_net models were not quite different, we just post the plots from lasso regression here.</p>
<p>We first plot the change of mean squared errors and coefficients when training the model using lasso. We also plot the predicted lv values vs observed lv values.</p>

<h4>Variants with non-zero coefficients</h4>
<p>We got 12 variants with non-zero lasso coefficients. For these variants, we performed single snp linear regression (LV89 ~ genotype of a snp) and made conparision in both training set and testing set.</p>
<p>Notations: <strong>coefficients_lasso</strong> is the coefficients from the lasso model. <strong>pval_lm_traindata</strong> is the p-value of F-statistics from the linear regression using the training set data. <strong>rsq_lm_traindata</strong> is the r-squared of the linear regression using training set data. Suffix &quot;_testdata&quot; means the results using testing set.</p>

<h3>LVs with relatively low pval_test_l</h3>
<p>By sorting the pval_test_l in the table above, we can get several LVs that have very low pvalues on testing set (LV40,73,45,78). We made scatter plots of predicted LVs vs. observed LVs for them. Besides, we did GWAS analysis.</p>
