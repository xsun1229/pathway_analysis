Using absolute paths to the files within your workflowr project makes it difficult for you and others to run your code on a different machine. Change the absolute path(s) below to the suggested relative path(s) to make your code more reproducible.

Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility.
</p>
<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version <a href="https://github.com/xsun1229/pathway_analysis/tree/9fe2a81f3730e415217b0088f55c02ff1bb43947" target="_blank">9fe2a81</a>. See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:
</p>
<pre><code>
Ignored files:
    Ignored:    .RData
    Ignored:    .Rhistory
    Ignored:    .Rproj.user/

Unstaged changes:

    Deleted:    output/nzero_variants.rdata
    Deleted:    output/snp001_le.jpeg

</code></pre>
<p>
Note that any generated files, e.g. HTML, png, CSS, etc., are not included in this status report because it is ok for generated content to have uncommitted changes.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In this part, the data and workflow are the same with <a href="https://xsun1229.github.io/pathway_analysis/pwy-plier-nochrx.html">pwy-plier-nochrx</a>. In last part, we extracted LVs using PLIER. But we just included the pathway dataset that containing KEGG pathway. In this part, we get all the pathways provided in ‘PLIER’ R package included to find if we can get better results.</p>
<p>The pathways are shown below.</p>
<pre><code>(1) bloodCellMarkersIRISDMAP - 
IRIS: Abbas, Alexander R., et al. &quot;Deconvolution of blood microarray data identifies cellular activation patterns in systemic lupus erythematosus.&quot; PloS one 4.7 (2009).

(2) canonicalPathways  - canonical pathway from MSigDB (*containing KEGG pathway*)
(3) chemgenPathways - chemical and genetic perturbations from MSigDB
(4) immunePathways  - Immunologic signatures from MSigDB
(5) oncogenicPathways - oncogeneic signatures gene sets from MsigDB
(6)svmMarkers - Newman, Aaron M., et al. &quot;Robust enumeration of cell subsets from tissue expression profiles.&quot; Nature methods 12.5 (2015): 453-457.

<h3>Overview</h3>
<ul>
<li>The gene expression data from GTEx using Ensemnl ID. In order to use PLIER R package, we need to convert Ensemnl ID to HGNC Gene Symbol. There are 19,696 genes in GTEx data. After conversion, 16634 left(not all Ensemnl IDs have a corresponding HGNC Gene Symbol). 13,030 of 17,143 were used in PLIER.</li>
<li>We used CanonicalPathways in PLIER R package, which contains 6611 curated pathways from Reactome and KEGG.</li>
<li>We obtained 96 LVs from PLIER, 50 of them have AUC &gt; 0.70(see figure below).</li>

<h3>Heritability of LVs</h3>
<p>We computed the heritability of all LVs. The following figure shows the distribution of the heritability.</p>

<p>For more details, we list the heritability of 50 LVs with AUC &gt; 0.7 below. We just list the top 3 pathways related to each LV, corresponding to the figure in ‘LVs with AUC&gt;0.70’ part.</p>
