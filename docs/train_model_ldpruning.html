Using absolute paths to the files within your workflowr project makes it difficult for you and others to run your code on a different machine. Change the absolute path(s) below to the suggested relative path(s) to make your code more reproducible.

Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility.
</p>
<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version <a href="https://github.com/xsun1229/pathway_analysis/tree/7cd442e7ed6c038aa7d47618134264d45648a3cf" target="_blank">7cd442e</a>. See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:
</p>
<pre><code>
Ignored files:
    Ignored:    .RData
    Ignored:    .Rhistory
    Ignored:    .Rproj.user/

Unstaged changes:

    Deleted:    output/LV5.jpeg
    Deleted:    output/nzero_variants.rdata
    Deleted:    output/snp001_le.jpeg

</code></pre>
<p>
Note that any generated files, e.g. HTML, png, CSS, etc., are not included in this status report because it is ok for generated content to have uncommitted changes.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>We performed same analysis with <a href="https://xsun1229.github.io/pathway_analysis/train_model.html">this part</a>. But the data are kind of different. After dividing the data into training part and testing part, we perfpormed LDpruning for the training data using Plink. The window size of ldpruning is 50kb, the step size is 5kb, the VIF is 5 (1/(1-r2), r2=0.8). After ldpruning, the average number of variants in training data decreases from 103,809 to 31,834.</p>

<p><strong>I’m kind of confused here, after ldpruning, some singnals have been omitted. I expected to get lower r-squared for each LV, but it seems that I’m totally wrong(see the scatter plot below). I plotted the r-squared obtained from all variants with p-val &lt; 0.01 vs r-squared obtained after ldpruning. Why is this so?</strong></p>

<p>Some LVs like LV6,LV8 have pretty low heritability but have very high r-squared. In such LVs, the training model always selected many variants(ncoef_nzero). Other LVs like LV101,LV113 have relatively high heritability but very low r-squared.In such LVs, the training model always selected few variants(ncoef_nzero).</p>

<p>For LV101, we performned more analysis to detect the reason why it has relatively high heritability(0.19) but low r-squared(0.071) in lasso.</p>

<h4>Variants with non-zero coefficients</h4>
<p>We got 15 variants with non-zero lasso coefficients. Although we got 15 variants in former analysis, these variants are not the same variants as before. For these variants, we also performed single snp linear regression (LV101 ~ genotype of a snp) and made conparision in both training set and testing set.</p>
<p>Notations: <strong>coefficients_lasso</strong> is the coefficients from the lasso model. <strong>pval_lm_traindata</strong> is the p-value of F-statistics from the linear regression using the training set data. <strong>rsq_lm_traindata</strong> is the r-squared of the linear regression using training set data. Suffix &quot;_testdata&quot; means the results using testing set.</p>
